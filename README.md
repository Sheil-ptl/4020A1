1. We need to standardize, as our 10 features can be very different, and need to be standardized to make an equal contribution to the tests. To standardize our features for a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we can use z scores and the formula:

z = (x - mean) / std

By organizing our values so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we've standardized our values, making them equally impactful for the next steps.

2. Two distance summary tables (Euclidean and Manhattan): min, max, mean, median distances

Euclidean Distance Summary:
minimum: 0.358
maximum: 9.434
mean: 3.882
median: 3.81

Manhattan Distance Summary:
minimum: 0.911
maximum: 29.395
mean: 11.512
median: 11.207

3. PCA: a table of variance explained by PC1, PC2, PC3 and a 3D scatter plot using the top-3 PCs.

PCA Table of Variance:
PC#        Variance        % of Variance
PC1        8.966           89.215
PC2        0.171           1.699
PC3        0.153           1.523

4. MDS: a 3D scatter plot produced using Classical MDS on the Euclidean distance matrix

5. In 3â€“5 sentences, argue which method (PCA vs. MDS) provided more insight and why.
