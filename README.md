1. We need to standardize, as our 10 features can be very different, and need to be standardized to make an equal contribution to the tests. To standardize our features for a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we can use z scores and the formula:

z = (x - mean) / std

By organizing our values so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we've standardized our values, making them equally impactful for the next steps.

2. Two distance summary tables (Euclidean and Manhattan): min, max, mean, median distances

3. PCA: a table of variance explained by PC1, PC2, PC3 and a 3D scatter plot using the top-3 PCs.

4. MDS: a 3D scatter plot produced using Classical MDS on the Euclidean distance matrix

5. In 3â€“5 sentences, argue which method (PCA vs. MDS) provided more insight and why.
